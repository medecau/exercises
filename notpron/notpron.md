notpron spoilers ahead!

## 1
- click the door

## 2
- didn't see any popup
- change the URL to go to the next problem

## 3
- again the URL must be changed, false becomes true

## 4
- there seems to be a piece of morse code
- the code is: 
  1. ...- --- --- -.. --- ---
    voodoo
  2. .--. --- .-- . .-.
    power
- clicking the medal/coin will direct to a protected page
- user is voodoo, pass is power

## 5
- "eyes like an angel smiles like a devil" is probably part of the lyrics for the song we're looking for
- Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is the artist for this song
- the music seems to be titled Simple Songs
- user is simple, pass is songs

## 6
- "an AlTernative?"
- this could be the "alt" parameter for the HTML "img" tag, it isn't.
- the page title points at the source code
- the source says "ascii is an alternative"
- searches for ascii point to "ascii table"
- oh boy, there's an inline frame I had looked at the src of but did not pay attention to the tag
- the source of the iframe has some integers that will surely map to ascii chars
- the numbers are:
  1. 108 105 108 107
    lilk
  2. 117 111 114 104
    uorh
- doesn't work ... _after a night of sleep._
- just looked around again and the auth comes from anagram, hmmm
- user and pass is kill and hour

## 7
- will have to look at the page source
- "times have changed in deutschland", ok...
- "what candy wrapper is it?"
- it's from a twix bar
- a search for german twix says that twix was known as "raider" until 1991
- changing the URL document to "raider" brings up a page saying "dnuorayawrehto"
- the next problem is available if we use "rediar"

## 8
- "JAY should PACK his stuff"
- "JAY PACK" sounds like something popular
- "water became wine"
- searching google for "-notpron jay pack wine" brings up a wikipedia entry for Jay McInerney
- He was a wine columnist for House & Garden
- tried a lot of stuff related to Jay McInerney and the literary brat pack
- noticed two mp3 files in the source code
- one is background noise the other doesn't play
- the "realm" of the authentication is: "mom, he formatted my second song"
- opened the file on a text editor, theres photoshop tags splattered all over
- changing the extension to .psd and opening it in viewer.app shows an image
- "name: inverted password: levelten", pretty obvious

## 9
- "tears under john's mad notes of pain 
  did he answer demon's call now"
- looking at the source, the text has span tags around some letters
- "turn me on dead man"
- the title is "revolution"
- changed the document name from "paulisdead" to "paulisalive"
- "yeah i know he is alive, but don't waste your time with the Mc!"
- the title is "wrong way", not sure...
- searching for "turn me on dead man" shows some info on beatles member Paul and their white album.
- People thought that Paul had died.
- Music "Revolution 9" was played backwards and some thought to hear the message "turn me on dead man"
- the auth realm is "colorful"
- john lennon is the beatles member that was killed
- ... reading about the beatles, still no idea what's the key-pass combo.
- cheated: the user is "turnmeon" pass is "deadman"
- should have noticed that both are in different lines and there was a previous reference to not use spaces in usernames and passwords, oh well.

## 10

- title is "he was impatient"
- there's a ring in the pic
- "quick quick, don't let me wait"
- "%SystemRoot%\System32\sndrec32.exe can capture "what u hear""
- the auth realm is: "operator woman said"
- there is new mp3 file in the source, I think it holds the answer...
- went out for a few hours
- I think that I need to speed up the mp3 play to understand what is said
- didn't work, looks like there is a hidden waveform in there...
- maybe I'm just paranoid...
- speeding up and changing the pitch seems to help, I think I hear "grey world"

## 11
- title is " ahead of its time"
- auth realm is "follow the truth"
- the auth points to a document called "crossview"
- crossview is a term used in stereography
- stereography was invented by Charles Wheatstone
- cheated again...
- found a tip pointing to the fact that the image for problem 11 is actually numbered has "screen12"
- changing it to "screen11" will bring up an image with the text "fucking pans"

## 12
- stereography was actually related to this problem
- "I'm ruining the third dimension!" ; "name me"
- "switch pics for parallel view"
- GIF me my picture back
- there is a zip file that contains a WMV of the dragon in the picture
- the auth realm is attention whore
- there's a "parallelview" document
- changing the extention of the image from jpg to gif will give us the animated 3d version
- the remote control in the image does not help with the 3d perception

## 13
- "no maths"
- title is "lucy not in the sky" seems to be a reference to a beatles song
- the picture has a clock with the number 4 and a ring with the number 10
- "he's been a bad boy"
- there are alerts on the picture: "2of5"; "3of5"; "xof5"; "5of5"; "xof5"
- the auth realm is "i live there"
- something about hell here
- the areas where the onMouseOver activates seem to have shadows/highlights that look like letters
  -2of5 M
  -3of5 V
  -5of5 L
  -xof5 I
  -xof5 D
- user "devil" pass "hell"

## 14
- title "He knew the feeling..."
- "don't use opera here"
- "what language is the password hint? use it properly!"
- the auth realm is "quoi?" or "what?
- the document is "beenthere" and may refer to being a riddle about a songs name
